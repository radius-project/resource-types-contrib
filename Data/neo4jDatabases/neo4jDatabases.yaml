      The Radius.Data/neo4jDatabases Resource Type adds a Neo4j graph database to an application.

      Example usage in an application Bicep file:

        resource neo4j 'Radius.Data/neo4jDatabases@2025-09-11-preview' = {
          name: 'neo4j'
          properties: {
            environment: environment
            // application: myApp.id // Optional: include when bound to an app
          }
        }

      Then add a connection from a Container (or other resource) to the Neo4j resource as needed.
