      The Radius.Data/neo4jDatabases Resource Type deploys a Neo4j graph database. To create a new Neo4j database, define an Application and Container resource in your application definition Bicep file.

        extension radius
        param environment string

        resource myapplication 'Radius.Core/applications@2025-08-01-preview' = { ... }
        resource myContainer 'Radius.Compute/containers@2025-08-01-preview' = { ... }

      Then add a `neo4jDatabases` resource.

        resource neo4j 'Radius.Data/neo4jDatabases@2025-09-11-preview' = {
          name: 'neo4j'
          properties: {
            application: myapplication.id
            environment: environment
          }
        }

      To connect to the new Neo4j database, add a connection between the container and the new Neo4j database. The final Container resource should look similar to:

        resource myContainer 'Radius.Compute/containers@2025-08-01-preview' = {
          name: 'myContainer'
          properties: {
            environment: environment
            application: myapplication.id
            containers: { ... }
            connections: {
              neo4jDb: {
                source: neo4j.id
              }
            }
          }
        }

      Within your container, your application code can obtain the host, port, username, and password values via environment variables automatically created.
