# Radius.Data/postgreSqlDatabases

## Overview

The **Radius.Data/postgreSqlDatabases** resource type represents a PostgreSQL database. It allows developers to create and easily connect to a PostgreSQL database as part of their Radius applications. The developer provides the administrator `username` and `password` directly on the resource; the `password` property is marked `x-radius-sensitive`, so Radius encrypts it at rest, redacts it on reads, and injects it decrypted only into the platform's Recipe.

Developer documentation is embedded in the resource type definition YAML file and is accessible via the `rad resource-type show Radius.Data/postgreSqlDatabases` command.

## Properties

| Property | Type | Access | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `environment` | string | Required | The Radius Environment ID. Typically set by the `rad` CLI. |
| `application` | string | Optional | The Radius Application ID. |
| `username` | string | Required | The administrator username for the PostgreSQL database. Passed to the Recipe as `{{context.resource.properties.username}}`. |
| `password` | string (`x-radius-sensitive`) | Required | The administrator password. Encrypted at rest, redacted on reads, and injected decrypted into the Recipe as `{{context.resource.properties.password}}`. |
| `database` | string | Optional | The name of the database. Defaults to `postgres_db`. |
| `size` | string (`S`, `M`, `L`) | Optional | The size of the PostgreSQL database. Defaults to `S`. The Recipe maps the size onto a concrete cloud SKU/tier. |
| `initSql` | string | Optional | Optional SQL script executed on first initialization to create tables, indexes, and seed data. |
| `host` | string | Read only | The host name used to connect to the database. Set from the Recipe module's output. |
| `port` | integer | Read only | The port number used to connect to the database. Set from the Recipe module's output. |

## Recipe Packs

Recipes for this resource type are provided through the platform Recipe Packs at the repository root under [`recipepack/`](../../recipepack). A platform engineer configures an Environment by deploying the Recipe Pack for their target platform, which registers the Recipe for `Radius.Data/postgreSqlDatabases` along with the Recipes for every other Resource Type on that platform.

| Platform | Recipe Pack | Recipe source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Azure | [`recipepack/azure/bicep-recipepack.bicep`](../../recipepack/azure/bicep-recipepack.bicep) | Direct module — Azure Verified Module `avm/res/db-for-postgre-sql/flexible-server` |

## Using the resource type

Add a `postgreSqlDatabases` resource to your application and connect a container to it. Radius injects the database's connection properties into the container as environment variables named `CONNECTION_<CONNECTION-NAME>_<PROPERTY-NAME>` (for example `CONNECTION_POSTGRES_HOST`, `CONNECTION_POSTGRES_PORT`, and `CONNECTION_POSTGRES_DATABASE`). See [`test/app.bicep`](test/app.bicep) for a complete example.
