# Radius.Data/postgreSqlDatabases

## Overview

The **Radius.Data/postgreSqlDatabases** resource type represents a PostgreSQL database. It allows developers to create and easily connect to a PostgreSQL database as part of their Radius applications. The developer provides the administrator `username` and `password` directly on the resource; the `password` property is marked `x-radius-sensitive`, so Radius encrypts it at rest, redacts it on reads, and injects it decrypted only into the platform's Recipe.

Developer documentation is embedded in the resource type definition YAML file and is accessible via the `rad resource-type show Radius.Data/postgreSqlDatabases` command.

## Properties

| Property | Type | Access | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `environment` | string | Required | The Radius Environment ID. Typically set by the `rad` CLI. |
| `application` | string | Optional | The Radius Application ID. |
| `username` | string | Required | The administrator username for the PostgreSQL database. Passed to the Recipe as `{{context.resource.properties.username}}`. |
| `password` | string (`x-radius-sensitive`) | Required | The administrator password. Encrypted at rest, redacted on reads, and injected decrypted into the Recipe as `{{context.resource.properties.password}}`. |
| `database` | string | Optional | The name of the database. Defaults to `postgres_db`. |
| `size` | string (`S`, `M`, `L`) | Optional | The size of the PostgreSQL database. Defaults to `S`. The Recipe maps the size onto a concrete cloud SKU/tier. |
| `initSql` | string | Optional | Optional SQL script executed on first initialization to create tables, indexes, and seed data. |
| `tls` | string (`required`, `optional`) | Optional | The transport policy for connections to the database. Defaults to `required`, which rejects plaintext connections. Projected to connected containers as `CONNECTION_<CONNECTION-NAME>_TLS`. |
| `host` | string | Read only | The host name used to connect to the database. Set from the Recipe module's output. |
| `port` | integer | Optional | The TCP port used to connect to the database. Defaults to `5432`, the standard port every Recipe in this repository provisions. A Recipe that provisions the database on a different port overwrites this value from its own output. Setting it in an application definition changes only the value reported to connected containers, never the port the server listens on. |

### Transport policy

Managed PostgreSQL offerings commonly reject plaintext connections. Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server ships with `require_secure_transport = on`, so a client that does not negotiate TLS fails to connect at runtime even though the deployment succeeds. The `tls` property makes that policy part of the contract: it defaults to the secure value, is discoverable from the schema, and is readable by a connected container as `CONNECTION_<CONNECTION-NAME>_TLS`.

Configure your client from that value — for example, pass `ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: true }` to the Node.js `pg` driver. Set `tls: 'optional'` only when the application cannot use a TLS-capable client.

Only the Azure Recipe enforces the policy on the server today, by mapping `tls` onto the flexible server's `require_secure_transport` parameter. The Kubernetes Recipe runs a stock `postgres` image that serves plaintext regardless of the value, so on that platform the property records the requested policy rather than observed server behavior.

## Recipe Packs

Recipes for this resource type are provided through the platform Recipe Packs at the repository root under [`recipe-packs/`](../../recipe-packs/). A platform engineer configures an Environment by deploying the Recipe Pack for their target platform, which registers the Recipe for `Radius.Data/postgreSqlDatabases` along with the Recipes for every other Resource Type on that platform.

| Platform | Recipe Pack | Recipe source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Azure | [`recipe-packs/azure/aks-recipepack.bicep`](../../recipe-packs/azure/aks-recipepack.bicep) | Direct module — Azure Verified Module `avm/res/db-for-postgre-sql/flexible-server` |

A Kubernetes Recipe is also maintained in this folder ([`recipes/kubernetes/`](recipes/kubernetes/)), but it is not currently registered by [`recipe-packs/kubernetes/default-recipepack.bicep`](../../recipe-packs/kubernetes/default-recipepack.bicep).

## Using the resource type

Add a `postgreSqlDatabases` resource to your application and connect a container to it. Radius injects the database's connection properties into the container as environment variables named `CONNECTION_<CONNECTION-NAME>_<PROPERTY-NAME>` (for example `CONNECTION_POSTGRESQL_HOST`, `CONNECTION_POSTGRESQL_PORT`, `CONNECTION_POSTGRESQL_DATABASE`, and `CONNECTION_POSTGRESQL_TLS`). See [`test/app.bicep`](test/app.bicep) for a complete example.

## Migrating Kubernetes consumers

The Kubernetes Recipes no longer return the user-supplied `password` or derived `connectionString` through `result.secrets`. Existing consumers of those managed secret keys must explicitly provide the password to the consuming Container. Author a `Radius.Security/secrets` resource with the same password passed to the database, then either connect the Container directly to that Secret for generated `CONNECTION_<CONNECTION-NAME>_<KEY>` variables or bind the key to the required variable with `valueFrom.secretKeyRef`, as shown in [`test/app.bicep`](test/app.bicep). This change does not silently create a replacement `connectionString`; applications that require one must compose it from the database connection values and the referenced password.
