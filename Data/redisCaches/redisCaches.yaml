      The Radius.Data/redisCaches Resource Type represents Redis, an in-memory data structure store used as a cache or database. 
      
      To deploy a Redis Cache resource, add the resource to the application definition Bicep file 

      param environment string
      resource redisCache 'Radius.Data/redisCaches@2025-08-01-preview' = {
        name: 'redisCache'
        properties: {
          environment: environment
        }
      }

      When `capacity` is not set, the value is assumed to be `S`(Small) in Recipes.

      To connect your application to the Redis Cache, establish a connection from the container to the Redis Cache as shown below. Once connected, all Redis Cache properties are automatically injected as environment variables into the container. 
      
      resource myContainer 'Applications.Core/containers@2023-10-01-preview' = {
        name: 'myContainer'
          properties: {
          application: todoapp.id
          container: {
            image: 'ghcr.io/radius-project/samples/demo:latest'
            ports: {
              web: {
                containerPort: 3000
              }
            } 
          }
          connections: {
            redisCache:{
              source: redisCache.id
            }
          }
        }
